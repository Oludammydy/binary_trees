# C - Binary trees

# binary_trees

A C-project assigned to a team of 2 by ALX
This is a group project where we learnt about the advantages,
and disadvantages of using trees as data structures. We learned how to
qualify trees and also, how to traverse them. 
Throughout the project, we implemented binary, made use of binary search, AVL, and Max Binary Heap trees.
