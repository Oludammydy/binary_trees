# C - Binary trees

# binary_trees

A C-project assigned to a team of 2 by ALX
This is a group project where we learnt about the advantages,
and disadvantages of using trees as data structures. We learned how to
qualify trees and also, how to traverse them. 
Throughout the project, we implemented binary, made use of binary search, AVL, and Max Binary Heap trees.

## Tests :heavy_check_mark:

* [tests](./tests): Folder of test files for all tasks. Provided by ALX.

## Helper File :raised_hands:

* [binary_tree_print.c](./binary_tree_print.c): C function that prints binary
trees in a pretty way.

## Header File :file_folder:

* [binary_trees.h](./binary_trees.h): Header file containing definitions and
prototypes for all types and functions written for the project.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. New node**
  * [0-binary_tree_node.c](./0-binary_tree_node.c): C function that creates a
  binary tree node with a given parent and value.
  * Returns a pointer to the new node, or `NULL` on failure.

* **1. Insert left**
  * [1-binary_tree_insert](./1-binary_tree_insert): C function that inserts a
  node as the left-child of another.
  * Returns a pointer to the new node, or `NULL` on failure.
  * If the given `parent` already contains a left node, the new node takes its
  place and the old left-child becomes the left-child of the new node.

* **2. Insert right**
  * [2-binary_tree_insert_right.c](./2-binary_tree_insert_right.c): C function that
  inserts a node as the right-child of another.
  * Returns a pointer to the new node, or `NULL` on failure.
  * If the given `parent` already contains a right node, the new node takes its
  place and the old right-child becomes the right-child of the new node.

* **3. Delete**
  * [3-binary_tree_delete.c](./3-binary_tree_delete.c): C function that deletes
  an entire binary tree.

* **4. Is leaf**
  * [4-binary_tree_is_leaf.c](./4-binary_tree_is_leaf.c): C function that checks
  if a given node is a leaf.
  * Returns `1` if the node is a leaf, `0` otherwise.

  * [5-binary_tree_is_root.c](./5-binary_tree_is_root.c): C function that checks
  if a given node is a root.
  * Returns `1` if the node is a root, `0` otherwise.

* **6. Pre-order traversal**
  * [6-binary_tree_preorder.c](./6-binary_tree_preorder.c): C function that
  traverses a tree using pre-order traversal.

* **7. In-order traversal**
  * [7-binary_tree_inorder.c](./7-binary_tree_inorder.c): C function that
  traverses a tree using in-order traversal.

* **8. Post-order traversal**
  * [8-binary_tree_postorder.c](./8-binary_tree_postorder.c): C function that
  traverses a tree using post-order traversal.

* **9. Height**
  * [9-binary_tree_height.c](./9-binary_tree_height.c): C function that returns
  the height of a binary tree.

* **10. Depth**
  * [10-binary_tree_depth.c](./10-binary_tree_depth.c): C function that returns
  the depth of a given node in a binary tree.

* **11. Size**
  * [11-binary_tree_size.c](./11-binary_tree_size.c): C function that returns
  the size of a binary tree.

* **12. Leaves**
  * [12-binary_tree_leaves.c](./12-binary_tree_leaves.c): C function that returns
  the number of leaves in a binary tree.

* **13. Nodes**
  * [13-binary_tree_nodes.c](./13-binary_tree_nodes.c): C function that returns
  the number of nodes in a binary tree with at least one child.
